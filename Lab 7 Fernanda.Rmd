Hi this is Fernanda 
How is it going
it going chill

if your collaboraor: 

load the tidyverse
read in the kermit data as 'kermit'
make some side-by-side histograms of the Score.pre for all respondents, separated by the gender column

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

k_d <- read_csv("kermit.csv")

kermit_hist <- ggplot(k_d, aes(x = score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 4) +
  facet_wrap(~Gender)
```
